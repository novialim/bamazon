// Running this application will list a set of menu options:
// View Product Sales by Department
// Create New Department
// When a supervisor selects View Product Sales by Department, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.
// department_id	department_name	over_head_costs	product_sales	total_profit
// 01	Electronics	10000	20000	10000
// 02	Clothing	60000	100000	40000
// The total_profit column should be calculated on the fly using the difference between over_head_costs and product_sales. total_profit should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias.
// If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add total_profit to the departments table.
// Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL.
// Hint: You may need to look into GROUP BYs.
// Hint: You may need to look into JOINS.
// HINT: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What's is it? Good question :)
